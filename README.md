# Typescript_project

In this repository, TypeScript files are used to create the logistics of an agenda with the typical personal contact data such as address, telephone number, e-mails, etc. 

Each class is in a different TypeScript file.

In addition, the following is done: 
- There is a main module (main) in which the defined classes are used to create 3 person records and show them in the terminal through console.log. using the necessary functions defined in the classes to obtain the data.

- One of the person records added is modified, searching by DNI and adding a new address, a new e-mail and a new telephone number. These changes are made by using methods previously defined in the classes.

- Finally, the 3 records with the changes previously made are shown in the console from the main module.

Some visualizations of the results after apply: 
```
node main.js
```
